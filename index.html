					<strong> Early Life </strong>
					<br />
					At the age of five, he made his acting debut in Robert Downey Sr.'s
					film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the
					teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less Than Zero (1987). In 1992,
					Downey portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for which
					he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA
					Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment
					Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for
					which he won a Golden Globe Award; however in the wake of two drug
					charges, one in late 2000 and one in early 2001, he was fired and his
					character terminated. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment
					program shortly after and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.
					<br />
					Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark / Iron Man
					in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron
					Man (2008). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's
					Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and
					its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

					<strong> Career </strong>
					<br />
					In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film Iron Man,
					with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating: "Downey
					wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the
					character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony
					Stark'."Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed
					that Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the Pirates of
					the Caribbean series: a lead actor who could both elevate the quality
					of the film and increase the public's interest in it. For the role
					Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five
					months to look like he "had the power to forge iron". Iron Man was
					globally released between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585
					million worldwide and receiving rave reviews which cited Downey's
					performance as a highlight of the film. By October 2008, Downey had
					agreed to appear as Iron Man in two Iron Man sequels, as part of the
					Iron Man franchise, as well as The Avengers, featuring the superhero
					team that Stark joins, based on Marvel's comic book series The
					Avengers. He first reprised the role in a small appearance as Iron
					Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, as a
					part of Marvel Studios' depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by
					providing continuity among the movies.
